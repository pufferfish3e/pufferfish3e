<h1>Welcome to my developer profile!ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<p>
  I'm Kendrick, a student with a strong fascination for the world of programming.  It all started during the holidays. I was getting bored of playing games every single day without fail. I felt inclined to try something new to get out of this "endless cycle of despair". That was when I wondered if creating my own games would be a fun and interesting way of passing time. Since then, I've been captivated by the potential of code to create innovative solutions and bring ideas to life!
